    # Step 4: Configure Docker to authenticate with Google Artifact Registry
    - name: Configure Docker for Google Artifact Registry
      run: |
        gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev  # Replace with your Artifact Registry's location

    # Step 5: Build the Docker image

    # Step 6: Push the Docker image to Google Artifact Registry
    - name: Push Docker image to Artifact Registry
      run: |
        docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${{ secrets.GCP_PROJECT_ID }}/jaswanth-repo/my-image:latest
